# Simply run this script with no arguments. It will first download the
# information HTML page by bundesbank and parse this page for blz
# updates. Then, the user will be asked whether one particular
# available file should be downloaded. If the user agrees, the file is
# downloaded, copied into BANKDATA_PATH, and converted into
# ktoblzcheck's format.

## Configuration
# Commands
$LYNX = "@LYNX@";

## Sanity checks
