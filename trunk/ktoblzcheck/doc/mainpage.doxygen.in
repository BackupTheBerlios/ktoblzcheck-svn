KtoBLZCheck is a library to check account numbers and bank codes of
German banks.


\section sect_quick Quick Start

Both a library for other programs as well as a short command-line tool
is available. It is possible to check pairs of account numbers and
bank codes (BLZ) of German banks, and to map bank codes (BLZ) to the
clear-text name and location of the bank. See \ref AccountNumberCheck
and \ref IbanCheck for more information.

(FIXME: Need to add more information here)
