KtoBLZCheck is a library to check account numbers and bank codes of
German banks.

Both a library for other programs as well as a short command-line tool
is available. It is possible to check pairs of account numbers and
bank codes (BLZ) of German banks, and to map bank codes (BLZ) to the
clear-text name and location of the bank.

How to compile:

Type 
"./autogen.sh" to create the necessary build-stuff

Type "./configure" to calculate some system dependencies.

"./configure --prefix=/your/prefix
--with-bankdata-path=/your/favorite/directory" compiles KtoBLZCheck
and reads the bank data at runtime from the specified path. The
default path is $prefix/share/ktoblzcheck where the default for
$prefix is /usr/local. The advantage is, you can update it regularly
at this location. Additionally you can specify another location at
runtime.

Now type "make", "make install"

And then give it a try:

"ktoblzcheck <your-bank-id> <your-account-id>"

FIXME: need some example BLZ/account ids here.

PS: "./configure --with-compile-into-lib" was disabled because the
compiler would need way too much memory to actually compile that.
