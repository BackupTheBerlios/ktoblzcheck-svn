KtoBLZCheck is both, a tool and a library to check pairs or
account-ids and bank-ids (german only).

How to compile:

type 
"./autogen.sh" to create ne necessary build-stuff

type "./configure" or "./configure --with-compile-into-lib" to
calculate some system dependencies.

Note: "./configure --with-compile-into-lib" compiles the ressource
file into the library, which means you can not modify the bankdata
file afterwards, on the other hand, you don't have to care for its
location.  

"./configure" compiles KtoBLZCheck without the bankdata file and reads
it at runtime. The advantage is, you can update it regularly but you
may have to specify the location.

Now type "make", "make install"

And then give it a try:

"ktoblzcheck <your-bank-id> <your-account-id>"
